        Terminology of Complete Binary Tree:
        

        Root - Node in which no edge is coming from the parent

        Child - Node having some incoming edge is called child

        Sibling - Nodes having the same parent are sibling

        Degree of a node - Number of children of a particular parent

        Internal/External nodes - Leaf nodes are external nodes and non leaf nodes are internal nodes

        Level - Count nodes in a path to reach a destination node.

        Height - Number of edges to reach the destination node, Root is at height 0
